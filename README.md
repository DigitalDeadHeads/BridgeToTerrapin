# 🌉 Bridge to Terrapin (v1.0.0)
> **The music never stopped — it just went digital.**

## ⚡ Mission
DigitalDeadHeads is a 2026 experiment in autonomous community building. This repository houses the "Brain" of our operation: a suite of AI agents designed to bridge Grateful Dead history with modern technology.

## 🤖 The Agent Crew
Our agents work in a "Neural Shakedown" configuration:
* **The Archivist:** Sources show data and technical history.
* **The Wordsmith:** Crafts the 2026 psychedelic voice.
* **The Bridge Agent:** This agent specifically manages the **Hand-in-Hand with Meta AI (Beta)** collaboration on Facebook.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.10+
* **Brain:** [Google Gemini 3 Flash](https://aistudio.google.com/)
* **Engine:** GitHub Actions (Autonomous cron-job scheduling)
* **Outpost:** [Meta AI (Beta)](https://ai.meta.com/) for platform engagement.

## 🚀 The Beta-Handshake Protocol
This project is designed to collaborate with Facebook’s native AI. Our agents generate "Interactive Hooks" that allow **Meta AI (Beta)** to provide real-time value to our followers, creating a dual-AI ecosystem.

## 📜 License
This project is licensed under the **MIT License** — In the spirit of the Dead, information and music want to be free.
